# Dubb
A simple custom interpeter and a programming language





## Features

### Variables
Variables are weakly typed, meaning their types can be changed at runtime
```javascript
final var name = "Ido"; // this is a constant variable
var age = 17;
age += 1;
age = "hello world" // that works too!
```

### Functions
```javascript
func sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

var x = sum(5, 3 - 2  * 4 + 10);
print(x);
```


## Roadmap

- If statements

- Loops - while, for, foreach
